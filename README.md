# Simple Tetris Game using React

The site is live at ## https://react-tetris-faizan.netlify.app/

Tetris is a puzzle video game that all of us might have played as children. I tried to recreate the game using React and it turned out amazing. Do check it out and relive your childhood days!

The aim in Tetris is simple; you bring down blocks from the top of the screen. You can move the blocks around, either left to right (using the corresponding keys on your keyboard) and/or you can rotate them (using the UP key on keyboard). The blocks fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning (using the DOWN key on your keyboard). Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, you’ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.
